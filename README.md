QMICAD: Quantum Mechanics Inspired Computer Aided Design
=========================================================

Quantum Mechanics Inspired Computer Aided Design (QMICAD) library is a 
collection of C++ classes and functions for simulation and design of 
nano-scaled devices using quantum mechanical tools such as Non-equilibrium 
Green's Function (NEGF) formalism. This library provides a common framework 
for NEGF so that it can be used with any empirical tight binding, k.p model, 
extended Huckel method and density functional theory codes. This library also
includes a generic empirical tight binding model and a k.p model which can be 
extended for any material with known parameters.
